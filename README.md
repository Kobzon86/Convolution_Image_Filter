# Convolution/Image_Filter SystemVerilog

2D filter SystemVerilog implementation

Abstract video streams are used as input and output data. Fully pipelined. 
A wrapper must be used to combine the convolution instances of each color, implementing the AMBA/Avalon controller and backpressure mechanism.

Testbench only accepts .bpm images.
